### Packages with colcon
A package contains your source, CmakeList.txt, headers, and package.xml (meta info) for your ROS programs. Colcon is the tool to build uour package.

1. Install colcon
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
   ```
2. Create workspace and navigate to workspace
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   ```
3. Add some source code to test building
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git -b humble
   ```
4. Setup colcin tab completion
   ```
   echo "source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
5. Build with colcon form `~/ros2_ws`. The `--sysmlink-install` creates symbolic links (symlinks) to the original files in the source or build directories instead of making copies
   ```colcon build --symlink-install ```
6. See the folders that were created (build, install, log)
   ```ls```
7. Source overlay from `~/ros_ws`
   ```source install/local_setup.bash```
8. Run node
   ```ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node```
9. To verify you are modifying your package and not the previous one, let's edit the name of the window. Hit `Ctrl+p` and search `turtle_frame.cpp`. Modify `line 52` to the following
    ```setWindowTitle("NicoleTurtleSim")
10. Rebuild, source, then run. Should see the name change
    ```
    colcon build --symlink-install
    source install/local_setup.bash
    ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
    ```

## Create ROS Package with Colcon
Here we will create our own package from scratch

0. Prerequisite - Install colcon and create workspace.
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   ```

1. Create package from `~/ros2_ws/src`
   ```
   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --node-name my_node my_package
   ```
2. Check out the files and folders that it made. Open files and see what's inside.
   ```
   include/my_package
   src/my_node.cpp
   CMakeList.txt
   package.xml
   ```
3. Build that package from `~/ros_ws`
   ```colcon build --packages-select my_package```
4. Source
   ```source install/local_setup.bash```
5. Run node
   ```ros2 run my_package my_node```
